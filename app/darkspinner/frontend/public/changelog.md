- Show the Darkrun build version at the start of root and subcommand help output, including bare general invocation.

- Consolidate directly suffixed indexes, `_vN` versions, numbered variants, and numbered loop families into one normalized folder and family DSE while preserving each WAV definition and its reconstruction metadata.
- Reduce successful Darkrun conversion output to the elapsed time without repeating source and destination paths.
- Treat `darkrun convert <source> .` like an omitted destination so conversion writes the default local `.ds` directory or package.
- Give every retail Spore WAV a pinned human-readable `~` alias without runtime lookup, remove hash identity suffixes from aliased files, and annotate DSE files with searchable audio-event, animation, package, and resource references for reconstruction.
- Trace Darkspore audio events through shipped animation, noun, level, UI, effect, and pre-baked resources, pin exact names and resource-owner contexts into searchable conversion metadata, and replace ambiguous unresolved audio trees with resource-role and event-identity folders.

- Replace Darkrun's external vgmstream dependency with native Go decoding and the Darkspin-maintained MP3 module for EA PCM16BE, XAS1, and MPEG-1/MPEG-2 EALayer3 v1 audio while continuing to encode edited WAVs as EA PCM16BE.

- Cache remote Crogenitor and server metadata locally, refresh servers in the background every two days, and refresh profile progress when a launched remote game exits.

- Give every campaign run a unique persisted loot seed, derive mission streams from the map and difficulty, and restore the exact drop random state when continuing from a checkpoint.

- Keep unlocked teleporters usable by every co-op member after allies cross or backtrack, and synchronize pad activation and teleport presentation across clients.
- Add /ai for multiplayer co-op and PvP to assist allies with basic attacks, occasional abilities, and nearby following; movement, /follow, or another /ai returns control to the player.

- Play a death animation for killed Dendrones before removing their corpses, while preserving their existing respawn delay.

- Honor party leave requests followed by trailing shutdown RPCs, remove disconnected heroes and companions from teammates' scenes immediately, and restore them on successful reconnect.
- Hold co-op NPC spawns and world updates until each player's dungeon scene is ready, and preserve queued packets across loading transitions so enemies cannot attack a client that missed their spawn.
